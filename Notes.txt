Binomial distribution:
n - no of trails an event is performed
X - No of trails success event occured
Coin tossing we can have a tail for binomial distribtuion because the data here is discrete.
Expected value = n * p(of success)
Higher the success probability, our tail will be left skewed. Vice Versa for lower probability i.e. tail will be right skewed

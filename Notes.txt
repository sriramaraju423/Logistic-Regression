Types of probability distribution:
Binomail
Negative binomial distribution

Regression: Y = f(x)
For logistic regression, we say the output in probability
Logistic is one among binary class classification technique
This particular logistic regression curve is called sigmoid curve
If you have a very large difference between multiple R2 and adjusted R2, it says that added variables are not contributing much
Both variables and data rows can help in increasing R2. Whereas adjusted R2 just variables.
Factoring: We use 'factor' to constraint that particular values to 0 and 1.
Probability of logistic regression that we get is around what we choose as 1.
Sigmoid curve cannot be drawn for multi logistic regression. Can be drawn to simple linear regression.

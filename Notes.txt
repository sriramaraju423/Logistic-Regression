Missing value doesn't mean the value is zero. Might be data entry error or any that sort of error.
Degrees of freedom: n-1
Addition of 5 variables causes decrease of residual deviance by some much and as well as degress of freedom by 5.
In confusion matrix we always go with analogy of 'always prediction'. And in False Negative, False positive remember as follows False = our prediction is false, Negetive or positive = prediction corresponding value
Eutopian model is perfect model
Specificity(For negetive) TN/(TN+FP) and Sensitivity(For positive) TP/(TP+FN)
Choosing cutoff optimun values is most important thing.
